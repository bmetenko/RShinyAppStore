## Remember your cellphone

> 
- Your Shiny interface can scale down to work on your phone. 
- Manually run it with a web connection using:
`runApp(host="0.0.0.0",port=5050)` 
- Figure out what your 192.168.#.### addresss using ifconfig or ipconfig.
- Anything connected to the same network can connect to, for example *192.168.7.107:5050*, to access the app. (Phone Image)
- taglist() can be used to render multiple UI elements at the same time.
-- This can be tied to an if statement that results in `return()` if no UI elements are needed fir a specific condition.
